## Design Understanding
## Justification of design decision

- ###	A modern yet minimalistic design was the inspiration behind the creation of this website. A clean and simple design appealed to me, so I created a simple silhouette with a very subtle color introduction. It was important to me to choose a color palette that complimented one another well without being overpowering.

## Why does this decision increase value for a client?

- ### Due to its very modern and clean look, I feel this design will appeal to the majority of people. I feel that the design captures the aesthetic appeal of today's people, which is more modern and contemporary. In addition, I believe that the site is very straightforward and easy to navigate, which is critical in attracting customers.

## Who is the target audience and how does this design consider their needs? 

- ###	The target audience consists of women and men between the ages of 20 and 60. This site is designed to cater to shoppers looking for a simple and easy shopping experience. In addition to providing all the necessary information, it streamlines the checkout process and reduces the amount of hassle.
